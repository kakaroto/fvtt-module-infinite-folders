# Infinite Folders

This Foundry VTT module allows you to create infinite depth of folders for Scenes, Actors, Items and Journals. No more limit to a depth of 2 folders (or none for Journal entries).
This will also add a 'New entity' button on folders so you can create it directly in the folder (does not work for Scenes though).

# Installation
Extract the infinite_fodlers.zip file to the public/modules directory. As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World ('?' icon on the side bar) then enable the `Infinite Folders` module.

# Using it
You can now infinite depth of folders for all entities. Note that Journal entries still need to be in a folder and cannot be unassigned like other entities.
