# Infinite Folders

This Foundry VTT module allows you to create infinite depth of folders for Scenes, Actors, Items and Journals. No more limit to a depth of 2 folders (or none for Journal entries).
This will also add a 'New entity' button on folders so you can create it directly in the folder (does not work for Scenes though).

# DISCLAIMER

This module creates folders and allows you to create data where it shouldn't be. If a future FVTT update enforces the 2-depth limit on the server side, then all of the deeper folders and their content may be lost.

In such a case, I will release a small tool to move those folders and their content back into the root folder, but that assumes the data wasn't lost on the server, so if you use this module, make sure you create backups of your worlds before applying any FVTT update.

# Installation
Extract the infinite_fodlers.zip file to the public/modules directory. As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World ('?' icon on the side bar) then enable the `Infinite Folders` module.

# Using it
You can now infinite depth of folders for all entities. Note that Journal entries still need to be in a folder and cannot be unassigned like other entities.
